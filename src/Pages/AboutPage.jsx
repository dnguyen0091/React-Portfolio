                            I picked up Web Development back in 2022 as a way to learn more about coding. From there I fully delved into the rabbit hole of the world of software engineering.
                            I discovered my passion for learning and the creation, which led me to pursue a career in this field. I am currently a student at the Unviversity of Central Florida, where I am studying Computer Science.
                            Outside of school and work, you can find me working on a personal project, enjoying games, at the gym, or spending time with my friends and family.
                            I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so if you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to reach out!
